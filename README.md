# Housing Price Prediction

A simple regression project using the **California Housing** (or **Boston Housing**) dataset to predict house prices with a Linear Regression model.

---

##  Features

- Fetches **California Housing** dataset from `scikit-learn` (or loads **Boston Housing** from Excel).
- Saves dataset to `.xlsx` for easy access and reproducibility.
- Implements **Linear Regression** using `scikit-learn`.
- Evaluates model using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **RÂ² Score**.
- Includes a scatter plot to visually compare Actual vs Predicted values.

---

##  Motivation

This project serves as a learning exercise in:
- Working with real-world housing datasets.
- Handling data extraction and file output (Excel).
- Building and evaluating regression models.
- Visualizing model performance to understand accuracy and bias.
